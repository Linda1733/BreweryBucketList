    <h3>Welcome to the Brewery Bucket List website.</h3>
    
    <p>With the increasing popularity of craft breweries popping up here in Central Pennsylvania, it would be 
        nice to have a place where you can record your visits to them, as well as others in Pennsylvania.<p>Guests are free to search for breweries on the Breweries page by either the County name or name of establishment.</p>
    
    <p>If you choose to create an account, your registration information will not be used for any purpose other than verifying your identity to retrieve your list information when you log in.</p>
    
    <p>This application has been set up to serve as my Senior Research coding project for Elizabethtown College.&nbsp; It is a work in progress and will continue to be udpated with additional functionality in the future.</p>
